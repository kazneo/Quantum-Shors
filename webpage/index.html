                    Among many encryption techniqes, RSA encryption is a widely-used asymmetric encryption method, central to securing data over 
                    the internet by providing confidentiality and authentication. It works with a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and 
                    a private key for decryption. The security of RSA relies on the computational difficulty of factoring large prime numbers, 
                    making it highly resistant to brute-force attacks with conventional computers. RSA is fundamental in protocols like SSL/TLS, 
                    which secure online communication, and in digital signatures, where it verifies the authenticity and integrity of documents or software.
        
                    Despite its strengths, RSA faces challenges, particularly due to the computational demands of its large key sizes, which make it 
                    slower than symmetric encryption for large data sets. Additionally, the future threat posed by quantum computing, which could break 
                    RSA's security through advanced factoring, is driving research into quantum-resistant alternatives like lattice-based cryptography 
                    and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), which offers comparable security with smaller keys. However, RSA remains essential in modern 
                    cryptography, particularly in hybrid models where it enables secure key exchange alongside faster symmetric encryption algorithms for data transfer.

                    Shor's algorithm presents significant cybersecurity implications for smart city infrastructure, as it could undermine the RSA encryption that many urban 
                    systems currently rely on. As cities adopt interconnected, digitally controlled systems—like smart grids, traffic management, and public safety networks—secure 
                    data transmission is essential to prevent cyber threats. However, with the rise of quantum computing and algorithms like Shor’s, these conventional encryption 
                    methods may become vulnerable, potentially exposing critical urban systems to cyberattacks.
        
                    To future-proof smart city infrastructure, urban upgrades will need to incorporate quantum-resistant encryption methods to mitigate the risks posed by Shor’s 
                    algorithm and quantum advances. Investing in quantum-secure technology now is essential to ensure that complex urban systems remain safe, sustainable, and 
                    resilient in the face of evolving cybersecurity challenges.
