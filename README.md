# Quantum-Shors

This is a project for RPI's Hackathon 2024. 


### Why this?
Shor's algorithm's implications for urban upgrades are primarily related to cybersecurity in smart city infrastructure. As urban areas incorporate more interconnected, digitally controlled systems—like smart grids, traffic control, and public safety networks—secure data transmission becomes essential to protect against cyber threats. Currently, many of these systems rely on RSA encryption for securing communications and sensitive information. However, with the advent of quantum computing and algorithms like Shor’s, traditional encryption methods could be vulnerable, potentially exposing critical urban systems to cyberattacks. 

To future-proof urban infrastructure, cities undergoing upgrades will need to adopt quantum-resistant encryption methods to safeguard against the risks that Shor’s algorithm and quantum computing pose. Investing in quantum-secure technology today will be essential for ensuring the security and resilience of increasingly complex urban systems, thereby supporting safe, sustainable, and reliable city upgrades.
