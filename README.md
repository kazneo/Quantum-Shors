# Quantum-Shors

HackRPI Project 2024

Shor's algorithm holds significant implications for the future of urban upgrades, especially in the realm of cybersecurity for smart city infrastructure. As cities integrate interconnected, digitally controlled systems like smart grids, traffic management, and public safety networks, secure data transmission becomes critical to protect against cyber threats. Many of these systems currently rely on RSA encryption to secure communications and sensitive information. However, with the advent of quantum computing and algorithms like Shor’s, traditional encryption methods could be vulnerable, potentially exposing critical urban systems to cyberattacks.

To future-proof urban infrastructure, cities will need to adopt quantum-resistant encryption methods to guard against the risks posed by Shor’s algorithm and quantum computing. Investing in quantum-secure technology today will be essential for ensuring the safety, sustainability, and reliability of increasingly complex urban systems, thus supporting secure, resilient city upgrades.
